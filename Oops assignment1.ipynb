        "1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class.\n",
        "   - It helps to restrict direct access to some of the object's components, which is known as **data hiding**. This ensures that the object's internal state can only be modified through its methods, improving control and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**:\n",
        "   - Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "   - It allows programmers to focus on a simplified view of an object or system, making the interaction with objects easier and reducing complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**:\n",
        "   - Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (called a **subclass** or **derived class**) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a **superclass** or **base class**).\n",
        "   - This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchies of classes, where more specialized behavior is built upon more general behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single function or method to behave differently depending on the object it is acting upon.\n",
        "   - This can be achieved through **method overriding** (inherited methods with modified behavior) and **method overloading** (same method name with different parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Composition**:\n",
        "   - Composition refers to building complex objects by combining simpler objects. Rather than inheriting from a parent class, one object can contain references to other objects, thus forming a \"has-a\" relationship rather than an \"is-a\" relationship (which is typical of inheritance).\n",
        "   - It promotes modularity and flexibility in the design of systems, where different components can be reused across different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "These core concepts provide a foundation for creating flexible, reusable, and maintainable code in object-oriented programming.\n",
        "\n",

        "3. Explain the difference between instance methods and class methods. Provide an example of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, **instance methods** and **class methods** are both types of methods associated with classes, but they differ in how they are defined and accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Instance Methods**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Instance methods are functions that belong to instances (objects) of a class. They can access and modify the object's attributes and are called on an instance of the class.\n",
        "   - **Self Parameter**: The first parameter of an instance method is always `self`, which refers to the current object (instance) of the class.\n",
        "   - **Access**: Instance methods can access instance variables (attributes) and other methods in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of an Instance Method:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
        "        self.make = make\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "        self.year = year\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Instance method\n",
        "    def display_info(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"Car Info: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an instance of Car\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
        "my_car.display_info()  # Calling the instance method\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Car Info: 2020 Toyota Corolla\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `display_info` is an **instance method** because it accesses the instance's attributes (`self.make`, `self.model`, `self.year`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Class Methods**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: Class methods are functions that belong to the class itself rather than to an instance. They are called on the class, not an instance of the class.\n",
        "   - **cls Parameter**: The first parameter of a class method is `cls`, which refers to the class itself, not an instance.\n",
        "   - **Access**: Class methods can access class-level attributes (those defined at the class level) but not instance-level attributes directly. They are often used to modify class-level state or perform operations related to the class itself, rather than specific instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example of a Class Method:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    # Class attribute\n",
        "    total_cars = 0\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
        "        self.make = make\n",
        "        self.model = model\n",
        "        self.year = year\n",
        "        # Increment the total number of cars whenever a new car is created\n",
        "        Car.total_cars += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Class method\n",
        "    @classmethod\n",
        "    def get_total_cars(cls):\n",
        "        print(f\"Total cars created: {cls.total_cars}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating instances of Car\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
        "car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2021)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling the class method\n",
        "Car.get_total_cars()  # Calling class method on the class itself\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Total cars created: 2\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `get_total_cars` is a **class method** because it operates on the class (`cls.total_cars`) rather than an instance. The `total_cars` class attribute tracks how many `Car` objects have been created, and the class method is used to access and display that information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",
        "- **Instance Methods**:\n",
        "  - Operate on instances of the class.\n",
        "  - The first parameter is `self`, which refers to the instance of the class.\n",
        "  - Can access instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Class Methods**:\n",
        "  - Operate on the class itself, not on individual instances.\n",
        "  - The first parameter is `cls`, which refers to the class.\n",
        "  - Can access class attributes but not instance attributes directly.\n",
        "  - Typically used for class-level operations (like keeping track of how many instances have been created).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How does Python implement method overloading? Give an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, method overloading is not implemented in the same way as in other languages like Java or C++. Python does not support method overloading by default, meaning you cannot define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, Python provides flexibility through default arguments, variable-length arguments, or using `*args` and `**kwargs` to simulate overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Overloading in Python Using Default Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "One common way to simulate method overloading in Python is by using default values for parameters, so that the function can accept different numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an instance of the Calculator class\n",
        "calc = Calculator()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling the add method with different numbers of arguments\n",
        "print(calc.add(10))        # Output: 10 (only a is passed)\n",
        "print(calc.add(10, 20))    # Output: 30 (a and b are passed)\n",
        "print(calc.add(10, 20, 30)) # Output: 60 (a, b, and c are passed)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `add` method is defined with default values for `b` and `c`. This allows us to call the method with either one, two, or three arguments, effectively simulating overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Overloading Using `*args` (Variable-Length Arguments)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also use `*args` to allow the method to accept any number of positional arguments, enabling overloading behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Printer:\n",
        "    def print_message(self, *args):\n",
        "        for arg in args:\n",
        "            print(arg)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an instance of the Printer class\n",
        "printer = Printer()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling the print_message method with different numbers of arguments\n",
        "printer.print_message(\"Hello\")           # Output: Hello\n",
        "printer.print_message(\"Hello\", \"World\")  # Output: Hello World\n",
        "printer.print_message(\"Hello\", \"World\", \"Python\")  # Output: Hello World Python\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the `print_message` method can accept any number of arguments, allowing different behaviors depending on the number of parameters passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Overloading Using `**kwargs` (Keyword Arguments)\n",
        "\n",
        "`**kwargs` can be used to handle method overloading by accepting any number of keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Greet:\n",
        "    def greet_person(self, **kwargs):\n",
        "        if 'name' in kwargs:\n",
        "            print(f\"Hello, {kwargs['name']}!\")\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            print(\"Hello, Guest!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an instance of the Greet class\n",
        "greeter = Greet()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling the greet_person method with or without a 'name' keyword\n",
        "greeter.greet_person(name=\"John\")  # Output: Hello, John!\n",
        "greeter.greet_person()             # Output: Hello, Guest!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `greet_person` method accepts any number of keyword arguments, and if a `name` is provided, it greets that person.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense (like C++ or Java), you can achieve similar behavior using default parameters, variable-length arguments (`*args`), or keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). This allows a method to handle a flexible number of inputs and provide different functionality based on the arguments passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are the three types of access modifiers in Python? How are they denoted?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, **access modifiers** are used to control the visibility or accessibility of variables, methods, and attributes within classes. Python follows a convention-based approach rather than enforcing strict access control like some other programming languages (such as Java or C++). The three types of access modifiers in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Public Access Modifier**\n",
        "   - **Denotation:** No underscores (`attribute` or `method`)\n",
        "   - **Description:** Public members are accessible from outside the class. By default, all attributes and methods in a Python class are public, meaning they can be accessed directly using an instance of the class or by inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "           self.name = name  # Public attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "       def greet(self):  # Public method\n",
        "           print(f\"Hello, {self.name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   p = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "   print(p.name)  # Accessing the public attribute\n",
        "   p.greet()      # Calling the public method\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Protected Access Modifier**\n",
        "   - **Denotation:** A single leading underscore (`_attribute` or `_method`)\n",
        "   - **Description:** Protected members are intended to be accessible only within the class and by subclasses (i.e., they are meant for internal use). However, this is only a convention and doesn't enforce strict access control. The use of a leading underscore signals to developers that the attribute or method is \"protected\" and should not be accessed directly from outside the class or subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "           self._name = name  # Protected attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "       def _greet(self):  # Protected method\n",
        "           print(f\"Hello from _greet, {self._name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   class Employee(Person):\n",
        "       def greet(self):\n",
        "           print(f\"Employee greeting, {self._name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   p = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "   # Even though it's possible, it's not recommended to access protected attributes\n",
        "   print(p._name)  # Accessing protected attribute directly\n",
        "   p._greet()      # Calling protected method directly\n",
        "\n",
        "   e = Employee(\"Bob\")\n",
        "   e.greet()  # Accessing protected attribute from subclass\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Private Access Modifier**\n",
        "   - **Denotation:** A double leading underscore (`__attribute` or `__method`)\n",
        "   - **Description:** Private members are intended to be used only within the class and are not accessible from outside the class, including from subclasses. Python does not prevent access to private members, but it \"mangles\" their names to make direct access harder. This is primarily a convention to indicate that the member is private and should not be accessed outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Name Mangling:** Python changes the name of private attributes and methods by adding a prefix `_ClassName`, making them harder (but not impossible) to access from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "   #### Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "           self.__name = name  # Private attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "       def __greet(self):  # Private method\n",
        "           print(f\"Hello from __greet, {self.__name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   p = Person(\"Alice\")\n",
        "   # Direct access to private members is not allowed\n",
        "   # print(p.__name)    # This would raise an AttributeError\n",
        "   # p.__greet()        # This would raise an AttributeError\n",
        "\n",
        "   # However, you can access them using name mangling (not recommended)\n",
        "   print(p._Person__name)  # Accessing the private attribute (name mangling)\n",
        "   p._Person__greet()      # Calling the private method (name mangling)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "- **Public (`attribute` or `method`)**: No leading underscores, accessible everywhere.\n",
        "- **Protected (`_attribute` or `_method`)**: A single leading underscore, intended for use within the class and its subclasses.\n",
        "- **Private (`__attribute` or `__method`)**: Double leading underscores, intended to be accessible only within the class itself (name mangling occurs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Python uses these conventions, they are not enforced by the language, and it's possible to access \"protected\" or \"private\" members if necessary. The conventions serve as a guideline to promote good coding practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Describe the five types of inheritance in Python. Provide a simple example of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, **inheritance** allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, enabling code reuse and establishing a relationship between the parent and child classes. Python supports different types of inheritance, each allowing for different ways of extending and modifying behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Single Inheritance**\n",
        "In **single inheritance**, a child class inherits from only one parent class. This is the simplest form of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an instance of Dog\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",
        "dog.speak()  # Inherited method from Animal class\n",
        "dog.bark()   # Method from Dog class\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Multiple Inheritance**\n",
        "In **multiple inheritance**, a child class inherits from more than one parent class. This allows the child class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes, but it can introduce complexity if the classes have conflicting methods or attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",

        "7. What is the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python? How can you retrieve it programmatically?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** refers to the order in which methods are inherited from a class hierarchy when a method is called. When a class inherits from multiple classes (as in **multiple inheritance**), Python follows a specific order to determine which method or attribute to use. The MRO is crucial to understanding how Python resolves conflicts when a method or attribute is present in more than one class in the inheritance chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MRO ensures that the method lookup is consistent and predictable in cases of complex inheritance structures. Python follows the **C3 Linearization** algorithm to determine the MRO, which produces a consistent order of classes from which methods are inherited.\n",
        "\n",
        "### MRO and the C3 Linearization\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's MRO follows the **C3 Linearization** (C3 superclass linearization) algorithm. This algorithm determines the order in which classes are considered during method lookup in a multiple inheritance situation. The goal of the C3 algorithm is to ensure that:\n",
        "1. The base class methods are resolved first.\n",
        "2. It respects the inheritance hierarchy and resolves conflicts in a consistent order.\n",
        "3. It does not break any parent-child relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How MRO Works\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider the following class structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class A:\n",
        "    def method(self):\n",
        "        print(\"A's method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class B(A):\n",
        "    def method(self):\n",
        "        print(\"B's method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class C(A):\n",
        "    def method(self):\n",
        "        print(\"C's method\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class D(B, C):\n",
        "    pass\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`. When calling the `method` of a `D` instance, Python needs to decide which `method` to call, and it uses the MRO to determine that order.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "d = D()\n",
        "d.method()  # Which method will be called?\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine the order, Python follows the MRO, which in this case will be: `D -> B -> C -> A`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retrieving the MRO Programmatically\n",
        "\n",
        "To retrieve the MRO programmatically, you can use the `mro()` method or the `__mro__` attribute, both of which return the method resolution order of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Using `mro()` method\n",
        "The `mro()` method returns a list of classes in the MRO for a given class.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Both `mro()` and `__mro__` return the same result. The MRO for the class `D` is: `D -> B -> C -> A -> object`.

        "   - `Shape` is an abstract base class derived from `ABC`.\n",

        "In this example, polymorphism allows the `print_area()` function to work with different shape objects (`Circle` and `Rectangle`). The function doesn't need to know the specifics of each class, it simply calls the `area()` method, which behaves differently depending on the object type. This demonstrates how Python's polymorphism works in practice: the same method name (`area()`) can be used across different classes with different implementations.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Explanation of the Magic Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`__str__` method**:\n",
        "   - The `__str__` method is used to provide a human-readable string representation of the object. This method is called when you try to convert the object to a string, for example, when you use `print()` or `str()`.\n",
        "   - In this example, it returns a formatted string containing the account number and balance of the `BankAccount` object.\n",
        "   - When you call `print(account1)`, the `__str__` method is automatically invoked, and you see the output in the format specified inside the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`__add__` method**:\n",
        "   - The `__add__` method allows you to define what happens when the `+` operator is used with objects of your class. It is automatically called when you do something like `object1 + object2`.\n",
        "   - In this case, when two `BankAccount` objects are added, their balances are summed up, and a new `BankAccount` object is created with the new balance. The account number for the new object is set to `\"MergedAccount\"`.\n",
        "   - When you do `account1 + account2`, Python internally calls `account1.__add__(account2)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Do These Methods Allow You to Do?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`__str__`**:\n",
        "   - It allows you to control how your object is represented as a string. This is especially useful when you want a custom string format to display your object in a more user-friendly or readable way. Instead of printing memory addresses or default representations, the `__str__` method lets you define a descriptive string that summarizes the object’s state.\n",
        "   - Example usage: `print(account1)` would print `BankAccount(Account Number: 123456, Balance: $1000)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`__add__`**:\n",
        "   - It allows you to define how the `+` operator works for your objects. In this case, adding two `BankAccount` objects results in a new `BankAccount` object with a combined balance.\n",
        "   - You can perform operations between two instances of the class using `+`, even though it would normally not make sense to add two objects together. You define the logic for what \"adding\" means within your class.\n",
        "   - Example usage: `account1 + account2` would create a new `BankAccount` object with a combined balance of $2500.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, overriding `__str__` provides a meaningful string representation, and overriding `__add__` allows you to control the behavior of the `+` operator between objects of your class.\n",

        "12. Create a decorator that measures and prints the execution time of a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "    To create a decorator that measures and prints the execution time of a function, we can make use of Python's `time` module. The decorator will wrap the target function, calculate the time before and after its execution, and then print the elapsed time.\n",

        "some_time_consuming_function()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`measure_execution_time` Decorator**:\n",
        "   - This decorator takes a function (`func`) as an argument.\n",
        "   - Inside the decorator, the `wrapper` function is defined, which wraps the original function.\n",
        "   - Before calling the function, it records the start time using `time.time()`, which returns the current time in seconds since the epoch (as a float).\n",
        "   - After the function executes, it records the end time and calculates the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n",
        "   - The execution time is then printed in a readable format (with six decimal places).\n",
        "   - Finally, the result of the original function is returned by the wrapper function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`some_time_consuming_function` Example**:\n",
        "   - The function `some_time_consuming_function` simulates a time-consuming task by using `time.sleep(2)`, which pauses execution for 2 seconds.\n",
        "   - When this function is called, the decorator measures and prints the time it took to execute.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Execution time of 'some_time_consuming_function': 2.000123 seconds\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "- **Decorator**: The `measure_execution_time` function is a decorator, which means it takes a function, wraps it with additional behavior (in this case, timing), and returns the wrapped function.\n",
        "- **Time Measurement**: `time.time()` is used to capture the time before and after the function call to calculate the elapsed time.\n",
        "- **Formatted Output**: The time is printed with six decimal places for precision, but you can adjust this based on your needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach allows you to easily measure the execution time of any function by simply decorating it with `@measure_execution_time`.\n",

        "\n",
        "   The **Diamond Problem** is a well-known issue in object-oriented programming, particularly in languages that support **multiple inheritance**. It occurs when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common ancestor, creating a diamond-shaped inheritance structure.\n",

        "\n",
        "The problem arises when we try to instantiate `D`. The key issue is how Python (or any language with multiple inheritance) should handle method resolution when class `D` inherits from both `B` and `C`, and both `B` and `C` inherit from `A`. If `B` and `C` both override methods from `A`, and `D` does not override them, the question is: **Which version of the method from `A` should be called?** The method from `B` or the one from `C`?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem Details:\n",
        "- **Ambiguity**: There’s ambiguity in determining which class's method to use when a method from `A` is invoked on an instance of `D`.\n",
        "- **Redundancy**: If `A`'s method is called indirectly through both `B` and `C`, you might get redundant or conflicting behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python's Solution: Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",

        "Python resolves the Diamond Problem using a method called **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**. This approach ensures that the method resolution is predictable, consistent, and avoids ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses a technique called **C3 Linearization** (also known as C3 superclass linearization) to create a clear, well-defined order in which methods are inherited and called. The MRO defines the order in which classes are looked up when searching for a method.\n",

        "### MRO in Python:\n",

        "1. **Class `D`** inherits from both `B` and `C`, and neither `B` nor `C` overrides the `method` in such a way that would create a conflict for `D`.\n",
        "2. When `d.method()` is called, Python looks up the MRO for class `D`.\n",

        "### How Python Resolves the Diamond Problem:\n",
        "Python uses **C3 Linearization** to establish the MRO. This algorithm ensures that:\n",
        "- The base class `A` appears only once in the MRO, even though it is indirectly inherited by both `B` and `C`.\n",
        "- The MRO respects the inheritance order as specified in the class definition (i.e., `B` before `C` in the case of `D`).\n",
        "- If two classes (`B` and `C`) both define the same method, the method from the class first in the MRO (`B` in this case) is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "### In Summary:\n",
        "- The **Diamond Problem** arises in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor, leading to ambiguity in method resolution.\n",

        "2. **Constructor** (`__init__`):\n",
        "   - Every time a new instance of `MyClass` is created, the constructor `__init__` is called. Inside the constructor, we increment the `instance_count` by 1.\n",

        "3. **Class Method** (`get_instance_count`):\n",
        "   - The class method `get_instance_count` is defined with the `@classmethod` decorator. This method takes the class (`cls`) as the first argument and returns the current value of `instance_count`.\n",
        "   - Class methods can be called on the class itself, not just on an instance of the class. This is why `MyClass.get_instance_count()` works, even though it's not tied to an instance.\n",
